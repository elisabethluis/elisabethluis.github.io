<p class="colorfultext" >YNIQUE Satchel Purses and Handbags for Women</p>

<p>I dont usually write reviews, but this purse is <b>amazing</b>. For the price, I thought I'd get something icky to just hold me over until I found what I wanted in a store, but it was <i>REALLY</i> well-made. It feels way more expensive than it is. The <span class="colorfultext" >pink</span> is such a <i>gorgeous</i>, bright, spring color and it fits a lot more stuff than I thought. Even the middle size crossbody bag is roomier than it looks. <i>Love it!!!</i> My only complaint was the fold from how it was packaged, but once I starting putting stuff in it, it filled right out. Love love love!</p>

<p><b>Love</b> this <span class="colorfultext">pink</span> purse! May pockets inside. There also is a removable pink zip bag, when you open there is handle so you can use by itself for a quick trip to store.</p>

<p>I am <i>in love</i> with this purse, i got it in the black alligator pattern, it comes with a zip up pouch/ wallet that fits my phone, cards, and a few small items. The pouch comes with a strape to go around your wiste or u can attach it to your outside of the purse where the purse strap is..</p>
